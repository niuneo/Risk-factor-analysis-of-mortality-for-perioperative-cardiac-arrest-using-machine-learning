Patient characteristics were compared by mortality outcome. For categorical variable, frequenceies and column percentages (%) were reported and p-values were calculated using 2 test or Fisher’s exact test when smallest expected frequencies are lower than 5. Continuous variables were tested for normality using both visual inspections (QQ-plots with histograms) and a formal inspection (Shapiro-Wilk test). Normally distributed continuous variables were reported using means and standard deviations (SD) and p-values were calculated using two-sample t-tests and on-way ANOVAs.
Non-normally distributed variables were reported as medians and first/third quartiles, with p-values calculated using Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon and Kruskal -Wallis tests. 

The analyses were done in R programming languages, version 3.6.3. The code has been uploaded on the Github as well <https://github.com/niuneo/Mortality-factors-analysis-of-perioperative-cardiac-arrest>.

#the p-value>0.05 implys that we do not reject the null hypothesis

## Export results in csv format

```{r export results, echo=FALSE}

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
